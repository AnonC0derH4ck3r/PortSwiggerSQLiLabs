# SQL Injection — Solved Labs

This repository contains write-ups and solutions for all SQL injection labs from [PortSwigger Web Security Academy](https://portswigger.net/web-security/sql-injection).

Each lab includes a step-by-step breakdown covering detection, exploitation, and the final payload used to solve it.

---

## What's Covered

- Retrieving hidden data via WHERE clause manipulation
- Subverting application logic
- UNION-based attacks for extracting data from other tables
- Examining the database type and structure
- Blind SQL injection (boolean-based and time-based)
- And more

---

## Structure

Each lab is a standalone markdown file named sequentially.

```
lab-1.md
lab-2.md
lab-3.md
...
```

## Labs

| Lab | Topic |
|-----|-------|
| [lab-1.md](./lab-1.md) | SQL injection vulnerability in WHERE clause allowing retrieval of hidden data |
| [lab-2.md](./lab-2.md) | SQL injection vulnerability allowing login bypass |
