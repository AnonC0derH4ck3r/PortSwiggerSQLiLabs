# PortSwigger Web Security Academy — Solved Labs

This repository contains write-ups and solutions for labs from PortSwigger Web Security Academy.

Each lab includes a step-by-step breakdown covering vulnerability identification, exploitation, and the payloads used to solve the challenge.

---

## Current Coverage

### SQL Injection (SQLi)

* Retrieving hidden data via WHERE clause manipulation
* Authentication bypass
* Database fingerprinting and version enumeration
* Database structure enumeration
* UNION-based data extraction
* And more

---

## Planned Categories

Additional lab categories will be added over time, including:

* Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
* Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
* Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
* XML External Entity Injection (XXE)
* Access Control Vulnerabilities
* Authentication Vulnerabilities
* Business Logic Vulnerabilities
* File Upload Vulnerabilities
* Path Traversal
* Deserialization
* Web Cache Poisoning
* And other topics covered by PortSwigger Web Security Academy

## SQL Injection Labs

| Lab                              | Topic                                                                               |
| -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [sqli/lab-1.md](./sqli/lab-1.md) | SQL injection vulnerability in WHERE clause allowing retrieval of hidden data       |
| [sqli/lab-2.md](./sqli/lab-2.md) | SQL injection vulnerability allowing login bypass                                   |
| [sqli/lab-3.md](./sqli/lab-3.md) | SQL injection attack, querying the database type and version on Oracle              |
| [sqli/lab-4.md](./sqli/lab-4.md) | SQL injection attack, querying the database type and version on MySQL and Microsoft |
| [sqli/lab-5.md](./sqli/lab-5.md) | SQL injection attack, listing database contents on non-Oracle databases             |
| [sqli/lab-6.md](./sqli/lab-6.md) | SQL injection attack, listing database contents on Oracle                           |
| [sqli/lab-7.md](./sqli/lab-7.md) | SQL injection UNION attack, determining the number of columns returned by the query |
| [sqli/lab-8.md](./sqli/lab-8.md) | SQL injection UNION attack, finding a column containing text                        |
| [sqli/lab-9.md](./sqli/lab-9.md) | SQL injection UNION attack, retrieving data from other tables                       |
| [sqli/lab-10.md](./sqli/lab-10.md) | SQL injection UNION attack, retrieving multiple values in a single column                       |

## File Upload Vulnerabilities

| Lab                              | Topic                                                                               |
| -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [fuv/lab-1.md](./fuv/lab-1.md)   | Remote code execution via web shell upload                                          |
| [fuv/lab-2.md](./fuv/lab-2.md)   | Web shell upload via Content-Type restriction bypass                                          |
| [fuv/lab-3.md](./fuv/lab-3.md)   | Web shell upload via path traversal                                          |
